                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>I am a dedicated Software Engineering student currently entering my final year (5th year) of my Information Systems Engineering degree. Throughout my academic journey, I have developed strong skills in software development, working on complex projects that integrate real-world requirements, modern architectures, and practical engineering practices.</p>
                <p>Over time, I have grown increasingly passionate about Data Science and Data Analytics. I am now actively expanding my knowledge in these areas, aiming to combine my software engineering background with analytical and data-driven approaches. My goal is to build solutions that not only work efficiently, but also provide meaningful insights and value through data.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I enjoy exploring new technologies, building structured system architectures, and solving real problems through code. I believe that the intersection of software engineering and data analysis is a space full of opportunities, and I am excited to continue growing and contributing in this field.</p>
